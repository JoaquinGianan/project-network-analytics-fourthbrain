**Notebooks**

# added notebook to check new datasets

Renato, the two notebooks in the jg_files/notebooks folder that are relevant are:
data_processing, and
latest_notebook

in data processing i have the initial feature extraction and the model that I used throuhghout the src work (16 features and multi class labels).  
i also have other models tested here to show that the xgbc classifier does a great job to begin with.
i also started to mark the cells that i would copy to a 'clean' notebook to have all in one place.

in latest_notebook, i started doing that clean notebook but also has all the test for getting the model.py and main.py working.  i also need to take from here the parts that i ended up using for the analysis and testing.
